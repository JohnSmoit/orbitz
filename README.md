# orbitz
2d multi-body orbital physics simulation in which multiple bodies with randomly generated sizes and masses are placed in a periodic boundary environment while simulating gravitational forces between multiple objects.
## Background
* This project is not currently in a working state but is getting close. 
* The final goal for this project is to create a simulation in which multiple bodies can be placed at varying velocities.
## Dependency
* Requires p5js
## Usage
* 
## Recent Changes
* Rewrote lines in the applyForce() method in planets.js to make forces apply themselves at a lower rate.
## Future Plans
* Add ability to create planets.
* Add ability to customize gravitational force of a planet as well as make stationary.
* Add collision to the planets.
* Add some artistic elements to make simulation easier to look at.
